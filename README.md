I have successfully fulfilled all the requirements for Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization. The map implementation loads the TileLayer without error, ensuring a smooth user experience. Additionally, the application connects to the GeoJSON API using D3 flawlessly, and earthquake markers are accurately sized based on magnitude. A detailed legend is included to clearly indicate depth levels through corresponding colors. On the data points side, each point scales according to the magnitude level and its color adjusts to reflect its depth. Moreover, every marker comes equipped with a tooltip that provides essential information, including the magnitude, location, and depth of the earthquake, and all data points load correctly in their designated geographical positions.
